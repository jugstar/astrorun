========== About Astrorun =================

Astrorun is a 3D Endless runner game that is loosely based off of the game "Run" from Coolmath games. 
Your main character is the American rapper, Travis Scott, who runs along an endless platform in space and collects coins as he goes. There are fun obstacles to overcome and a store where you can purchase unique skins for your character to wear.
